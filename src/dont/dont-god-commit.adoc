=== God commit

God commits or big bang commits are not good because they are difficul to understand and review, these can block pull requests.

Also if a commit needs to be cherry picked in/out, then it makes it very difficult.

For example if files are being reformatted, this should be done in 1 commit, not with other changes otherwise it is confusing.

TIP: Each commit should do one single item
