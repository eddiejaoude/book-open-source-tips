== Preface

The Open Source community is thriving. Each day the number of Open Source projects grows, as does the army of contributors that maintain them. While this is exciting for the industry, it can be daunting as a developer new to the community. This book aims to provide some tips for newcomers to help them avoid the pitfalls of Open Source development and learn from the community's collective wisdom.

As the ancient proverb goes, "_Time and tide [and technology] wait for no man_". And to the best of our ability, neither will this book. Remember to check the version number for updates! We're currently on v{version}.

== Intro

Open Source is dominating the software industry. Its champions include well known organisations like Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, LinkedIn and Google (Android/Chrome), but more significantly, an army of passionate individual developers around the world. Their efforts have impacted almost every part of computer science, culminating in millions of open source projects, with billions of lines of code!

While this abundant ecosystem has been of huge benefit to the whole industry, it can also make it difficult for newcomers to know where to start. If you're a newcomer, you might be faced with questions such as _"How can I contribute to the Open Source community?"_ Or, _"How do I choose between so many competing projects?"_. The following DOs and DON'Ts aim to address some of those basic questions, plus some pointers for aspiring Open Source developers.

Let's dive right in.

TIP: Projects not made public at the beginning are at higher risk of having private credentials committed in the history. Therefore it is highly recommended to make projects public from the start, stating they are not finished is not an excuse as they will never be finished. If public from day one, then the right mindset is used and thus reduces the risk.
