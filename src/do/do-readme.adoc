=== Readme file

Documentation is usually left to last, avoid doing this. You should start every project with at least a `README.md` with some basic information, for example a QuickStart guide, if you change features or functionality, try at least update this with your commits. Include a clear description of the project and perhaps some information regarding contacting, or how you prefer people the contribute.
