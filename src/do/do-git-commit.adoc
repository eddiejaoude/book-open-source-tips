=== Git commit

Git commits should be small and atomic, be it a single change or small feature. This will make your commit messages easier to write and and changes will be grouped logically. There are many benefits to this:

* Looking back through the history will be clear & easy to understand
 - if you want to find something
 - undo / remove some work
* Automate the changelog generation as part of your build for tag & package etc

==== Commit message

* Limit the subject line to `50` characters
* Do not end the subject line with a period `.`.
* If more than `50` characters use the body (description)
* Wrap the body at `72` characters.
* Use the body to explain `why` not `how`, this can been seen in the code

TIP: Before doing the commit, check the `git diff` to make sure you are not committing anything you do not want to, or should not be.
