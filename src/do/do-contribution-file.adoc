[quote, GitHub, GitHub Contributing Guidelines]
Often times open source projects place a CONTRIBUTING file in the root directory. It explains how a participant should do things like format code, test fixes, and submit patches. Here is a fine example from puppet and another one from factory_girl_rails. From a maintainer's point of view, the document succinctly communicates how best to collaborate. And for a contributor, one quick check of this file verifies their submission follows the maintainer's guidelines.
