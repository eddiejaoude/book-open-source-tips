=== Always respond - Issue and Pull Request

Always respond to Issue and Pull Request in a timely fashion, ideally within 24 hours (even if it is with a comment acknowledging you have at least read the issue & will respond fully in 3 days). This manages expectations for when the contributor can expect a full response.

Screenshots are really handy!
